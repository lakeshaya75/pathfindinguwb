You need python 3.8+ to run this.

Steps to run:
- Save both the .geojson file and the .py file in the same folder
- Run "python -m pip install geopandas networkx matplotlib" in Windows Terminal
- Run python, then:
>>> import geopandas
>>> import networkx
>>> exit()
- Change your directory to where you saved both files and run the python file & it should work
